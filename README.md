# Problem
Residents face barriers to attending and participating in local government meetings, even when they have the legal right to do so. 

# Solution
This Toolkit helps community members learn about the local government meetings in their community through a web research and mapping activity, provides a Google Form and instructions for conducting an environmental scan (STEEPLE Analysis) to learn about their community in preparation to working together, provides a Google Form that they can use to evaluate access to public meetings, and offers some tools for analysis of results and making recommendations.
 
# How to Contribute
* Form a local community team motivated to improve access to public meetings in your community. Check out THE OPEN MEETING TOOLKIT WEBSITE to learn more.
* Carry out internet research to add meetings in your community to the map on the website. See THE OPEN MEETING TOOLKIT WEBSITE for instructions. 
* Adapt the Toolkit for use in your state by replacing North Carolina-specific resources with resources for your state.
