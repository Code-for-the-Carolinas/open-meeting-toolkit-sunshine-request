  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Do you wish it were easier to participate in your local government? This website provides a Toolkit to support a team of volunteers working to improve access to public
    meetings in their North Carolina community. Resources include instructions for mapping public meetings, a checklist for doing an environmental scan of local community
    features that affect public meetings, forms for taking structured notes about public meetings (before, during, and after), guidance on synthesizing observations, and
    examples of ways to recommend improvements through feedback, policy change, and partnerships.
  </p>
   <p>
    The Open Meeting Toolkit for the Carolinas builds on the Open Meetings Policy project by Sunshine Request and
    Code for Asheville. Volunteers in Asheville attended local government meetings, observed barriers to participation, synthesized their findings, developed a
    policy proposal, gathered support, and presented that proposal to their local government. Code for the Carolinas volunteers realized the potential in
    their project to improve access to local government statewide and to engage civic technology volunteers with a variety of skills and backgrounds. Code
    for America recognized this scaling project as a Summer 2022 Impact Sprint.
    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <p>
    While no specialized technical knowledge is needed to use the Toolkit, at least one member of your team should be proficient with the Google Suite.
      All Toolkit resources are hosted by Sunshine Request on their
      <a href="https://github.com/sunshine-request" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and
      <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Irt-PMG0ZBGti6Dea2fg8Fc7NrM05f4N?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Workspace</a>.
    A team leader should create a Google Folder for your team's files related to the Open Meeting Toolkit and contact Sunshine Request at records@sunshinerequest.com to be added as a Collaborator on the Google Forms. GitHub knowledge will only be needed if your team chooses to host a local copy of the map.

    <!--Local Scan & Toolkit Instruction Section-->
    <section id="scan-section">
      <h2>Local Scan</h2>
      <p>
        Start by getting to know more about your community and the public meetings your local government holds. The Toolkit's local scan
        includes two activities to help you prepare: a map of public meetings and an environmental scan, called a STEEPLE analysis. Consider hosting
        one or more kickoff events for your team to do these activities as they prepare to use the Toolkit.

          <h3>Add Meetings to the Map</h3>
        </summary>
        <p>
          The Public Meetings in North Carolina map is a tool to visualize and learn about public meetings in North Carolina.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Adding meetings to the map is a jump-right-in activity that lets any new volunteer contribute to the project.</li>
          <li>The map can be a compelling visual for outreach to engage new participants. </li>
          <li>The map can be useful to local teams planning to evaluate meetings. </li>
          <li>Neither Sunshine Request nor Code for the Carolinas has committed to completing or maintaining a statewide map.
            Your team also has no obligation to complete or maintain a local map. If you identify a local community organization with a
            long-term interest in open government, you may want to consider making a local version of the map for that partner organization to host and maintain.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         North Carolina’s public meetings law, Article 33, Meetings of Public Bodies, states: “If a public body has a Web site and has established a schedule of regular meetings, the public body shall post the schedule of regular meetings to the Web site.” This section explains how your team can collect data on county or city meetings and provide that data to Sunshine Request so it can be added to the Map of Public Meetings in the Carolinas.
         </p>
         <p>
        The process of adding your community's meetings to the map has four steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
        <li>Find the relevant information for the city/county.</li>
        <li>Decide whether to collect data manually or through web scraping.</li>
        <li>Collect the information.</li>
        <li>Add the information to the map.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         This process requires spreadsheet software skills and internet search skills.  Web-scraping requires some programming skill.
         </p>
         <p>
         A local team leader should read the complete instructions to prepare for the activity. There is also a document with more detailed instructions you could use adapt for use as a handout for team members, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nn2dBH0zFVuw5SuKsKKsInglghcS9bu9tsPa3bRmsUY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Sample Kickoff Event Map Activity Instructions</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        A local team leader should read the complete instructions to prepare for the activity. There is also a document with more detailed instructions you could use as a handout for team members.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 1: Find Information</h4>
        <p>
        Put the county or city name, the state, and terms like “boards” or “commissions” (for example, “alamance county north carolina boards commissions”) into a search engine. Include the state to avoid confusion when there are places with the same name in multiple states. One of the top links will usually be a page that lists several boards and commissions.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 2: Decide How to Collect Information</h4>
        <p>
        If your team does not have someone with programming skills, you will collect information manually. You can skip the rest of this step.
        </p>
        <p>
        Examine the main page that lists multiple boards and commissions.
        </p>
        <p>
        If the page contains information about many meetings arranged in a standard format, and your team has someone with programming skills who wants to try web scraping, web scraping may help you collect data more quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
        If the information about meetings is not provided in a consistent format, web scraping probably wouldn’t save you time over manual data collection. Both manual and web scraping processes are described in the next section.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 4: Collect Information</h4>
        <p>
        There are two ways to collect the data: manual and web scraping.
        </p>
        <p>
        Manual data collection means examining the information listed on local government websites for and completing the relevant fields for individual meetings in a spreadsheet.  If you are doing it this way, open a workbook in any spreadsheet program that can export a CSV file.  Make sure that the columns in the workbook correspond to the fields listed below in the Data Dictionary.
        </p>
        <p>
        Web scraping can save you time if the pages that list public meetings on local government websites are sufficiently well-structured. Web scraping involves writing or modifying a script to automate the data collection and to produce a CSV file. The fields in the CSV file you output should match those listed in the Data Dictionary.
        </p>
        <p>
        We provide some sample web scraping scripts in C# and Python. These can be used for reference on future web scrapers. Within the GitHub repository openmeetingtoolkitdata is the “publicmeetings/Scrapers” directory.  The README file in that directory contains more information on the scrapers themselves. The directory contains two groups of files: some county-specific scrapers using Python’s BeautifulSoup library, and a C# scraper designed to handle multiple counties, as well as automating some other parts of the process (particularly getting the latitudes and longitudes of the meetings).
        </p>
        <p>
         If you prefer a different programming language for web scraping, you can use your preferred language to write a script that provides output as a CSV file with the fields from the Data Dictionary.
        </p>
        <p>
        Meetings pages are often somewhat incomplete or irregularly structured. Some amount of manual data collection and data cleaning will probably still be necessary. All of the web scraping operations using the code mentioned above did require additional manual work.

        <h5>ID Field</h5>
        <p>
        The ID field must be a unique string. Meetings currently on the map use integers as IDs. To make sure your team’s IDs are unique, we recommend you use the form countyx, where x is a unique integer that you assign to each meeting record.
      </p>
      <p>
        Latitude and Longitude
      </p>
      <p>
        Latitude and longitude will almost certainly not be included in the data. There are many tools that will provide latitude and longitude based on a street address. A complete address including zip code is extremely important for these tools to return the correct latitude and longitude. Google Maps works well to confirm the location of individual meetings. The <a href="https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/" target="_blank">US Census Bureau geocoder</a> offers an API for batch geocoding.  Both services can return latitude and longitude information about the location.  Please check the results that you get from these services, as there have been some instances where the returned coordinates were in another county or were otherwise incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some common issues that have been seen in the data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The meeting location or time is given as “varies” or something similar.</li>
        <li>Sometimes only a location is given, without an address. If you want to include the meeting, you may need to do further research to find the address.</li>
        <li>End times may not be listed.  Sometimes this is replaced with an estimate of the meeting length.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Use your judgment in resolving these data issues, keeping in mind the map’s role as an activity for learning and exploring. However, please only provide verified locations to Sunshine Request. If a meeting has no fixed location, put a 1 in the Placeholder column.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the information has been fully collected, save or export the spreadsheet as a CSV file. 
      </p>
      <h4>Step 4: Add Information to the Map</h4>
      <p>
        Provide your CSV file to Sunshine Request and their team will add it to the map. Email the file to records@sunshinerequest.com . Allow about a week for the Sunshine Request team to update the map with your meetings.

      <!--STEEPLE Analysis Section  -->

        <summary>
          <h3>Complete a STEEPLE Analysis</h3>
        </summary>
        <p>
          The STEEPLE Analysis helps you get to know your community in ways that will help you identify barriers
          to participating in public meetings. When the Code for the Carolinas team shared this part of the Toolkit with
          Sunshine Request and Code for Asheville, they said that this type of up-front analysis would have made their work a lot easier! As you work on the
          STEEPLE Analysis, keep in mind that it is a learning activity. Focus more on learning and incorporating multiple perspectives than on getting all of the answers "right."
        <p>
          The STEEPLE Analysis comes from a tool called the PEST analysis.
          It was developed by Harvard Business Professor Francis J. Aguilar,
          in his 1964 book Scanning the Business Environment. The main idea behind this process is
          to get a general impression of the community where you will be evaluating public meetings.
          We are using <a href="https://www.professionalacademy.com/blogs/marketing-theories-pestel-analysis/" target="_blank">a version of the tool from management training firm Professional Academy</a>, which
          asks questions about the Social, Technical, Environmental, Economic, Political, Legal, and
          Ethical characteristics of the local community. The letters have been rearranged to STEEPLE
          so it is easier to remember and also organizes related concepts in a more logical order for our topic (example: political next to legal).
        </p>
        <!-- Instructions -->
        <details>
          <summary><span>STEEPLE Analysis Instructions:</span></summary>
          <p>Plan to bring your team together for about one to two hours to complete the STEEPLE Analysis. You will do this
            analysis to help your local team prepare to evaluate local government meetings. The analysis can be done online or in person. We
            do recommend that you bring team members together to work on the analysis at the same time. As a local team leader, you should read the complete instructions in advance to prepare for the activity.</p>
            <p>
            Decide how your team wants to work on the STEEPLE Analysis. Here are two things to consider as you plan for the activity:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Does your team know each other? Lead a round of synchronous or asynchronous introductions to get
                acquainted before you start work on the STEEPLE analysis.
              </li>
              <li>
                How will you collaborate? You may choose to collaborate in person or online in a videoconference,
                <a href="https://etherpad.org/" target="_blank">in an Etherpad</a>, or using some other method. Consider using a brief icebreaker that invites participants to share
                about their connections to the community, like "Compare [your community] to another place you have lived or visited." or "How would you describe [your community] to someone who just moved here?"
              </li>
            </ol></p>

          <p><strong>Fill in STEEPLE Analysis Questions</strong></p>

          <p>The STEEPLE analysis has seven parts. The full text of the questions are listed below so all team members can easily refer to them. You may also want to review this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSbsYmFyDrI_LSf9dd2P_hpkyNtm3yXTVsamFpTQQlx_8Dt9URgTdWOUtSbAdXCM0C5QjQ8WBF7FWTD/pub" target="_blank">STEEPLE Analysis Example</a> for Cumberland County.
            Keep in mind that there is no single right answer to many of these questions. Plan to spend no more than about 10 minutes on each section. There is a text box at the end of the survey
            where you can include any additional information or clarify your responses. The form is set to automatically save your responses as they are entered. You can
            always go back and adjust your responses in the Responses section of the Google Form. To maximize learning as a team and as individuals, work on all parts of the analysis together as a team. Ideally all team members will help with
            the STEEPLE analysis, with one person entering the team's answers into the form. There are some time-saving suggestions for breaking up the work in the Political and Legal sections. It is especially valuable for
            the whole team to work together on the Ethical section.</p>

        When your team has completed the local scan, it's time to plan which meetings you will attend. Look over meeting
        data for your community on the Map of Public Meetings, on the meetings data file your team prepared, or on the website of your local government.
        We recommend that you create an initial plan to observe meetings over a period of three months, then begin to analyze your evaluations as a team.

            comment, and difficult to know what to expect from the process.</li>
          <li>Public comment and other opportunities for feedback are not provided at every meeting - there should be
            consistent, ongoing opportunities for public input.</li>
          <li>Public comment is not allowed for all agenda items, and the criteria under which comment is allowed varies
            between public bodies. </li>
          <li>The current public comment process requires a burdensome advance sign-up process that requires disclosure
            of unnecessary personal information.</li>
          <li>Due to technical or process issues, residents have been disconnected or skipped during public comment
            periods. We lack a fair process to ensure these residents are provided an opportunity to participate.</li>
          <li>Meeting materials are not posted online in advance of meetings on a clear, consistent schedule. Meeting
            minutes are not consistently posted in a timely manner after meetings.</li>
          <li>Meeting materials do not contain a clear indication of updates or modifications to documents that were
            posted previously.</li>
          <li>Local government entities publish meeting information on a variety of platforms and websites, making it
            difficult to know which source of information is the official (and most up-to-date) source of information.
            This creates additional work for staff and board members as any updates need to be posted in multiple
            locations.</li>
          <li>Basic board information, such as membership, contact information, meeting schedules, and bylaws are not
            posted or updated consistently for all public bodies.</li>
          <li>Local government entities lack data-driven metrics of public participation, such as
            the number of comments or the methods under which they were provided. As a result, it is
            challenging for staff, elected officials, or the public to analyze how changes to the public
            meeting process increase or decrease public participation.</li>
          <li>Due to a lack of consistency in the process for public participation, it can be

  <h4>Web Accessibility Evaluation</h4>
  <br>
            The Open Meeting Toolkit helps you focus on identifying barriers to participation, especially barriers that exclude people who are frequently left out of local government decisions. The questions in this section have been developed to help you learn about assistive technologies and tools to identify website accessibility problems. These questions help you center empathy for people who use these websites and give you practical tools that you may find helpful in your own work.
            <br>
            <br>
            When answering these questions, consider all of the web pages where you found information for the previous questions. Be sure to allow enough time to familiarize yourself with the resources at the links in the questions, especially for your first Before-Meeting evaluation. You may also find it helpful to use the free <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/browser-extensions/">Axe Browser Extension for Accessibility Testing</a> or a similar automated tool to review the web page.

        <h2>Analysis</h2>
  <p>You are welcome to analyze your team's findings using any method that is comfortable for you. We have developed a suggested method of analysis aligned with the Open Meetings Policy developed by Code for Asheville and Sunshine Request.</p>
  <p>The Open Meetings Policy is divided into sections, including Basic Public Body Information, Public Meeting Information, Public Meeting Materials, Meeting Procedure, and Public Participation. The analysis approach described here has the
  goal of helping you understand whether the problems they found also exist in your community. This can be a starting point to make a decision about whether you want to recommend the same or similar policy changes as they did. You
  may want to refer back to the section above called Sunshine Request and Code for Asheville Observations
  as you begin your analysis.  </p>
  <p>
    The Analysis Spreadsheet you have used to collect Meeting Evaluations contains Google Sheets macros that can be used to view columns with responses related to each section of the policy proposal. What each macro does is explained on the
    Macro Descriptions tab of the Analysis Spreadsheet. After using a macro to refine a view, use the AllColumns macro to unhide all columns before using another macro.
  </p>
  <p>For example, use the Participation macro to see responses by your team members related to the ability of members
    of the public to participate in meetings. If you observe similar barriers to those observed in Asheville, you may want to make a similar policy recommendation.
  </p>
    </section>
    <section id="recommendations-section">
      <h2>Recommendations</h2>
      </p>
      <p>As you decide what changes to recommend, here are three approaches to consider: <strong>Feedback</strong>, <strong>Policy</strong> & <strong>Partnerships</strong>. </p>
      <h2>Feedback</h2>
      <p>Feedback means telling local government staff about barriers you observe at public meetings. You may have opportunities to
        provide this through surveys or a web form. You can also use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSSRd_cRBXaQN4DkUkkLYwrmKnHdAsAMSwbzu2Azgewaal5a1Z2xKr-jB60PK_OUPO6VqWngXeKgJtE/pub"
        target="_blank">Sunshine Request Meeting Accessibility Email Templates</a>. This document
      includes sample emails and advice on how to find the right person to contact. </p>
      <h2>Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Sunshine Request and Code for Asheville created a policy proposal called the <a
          href="https://https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQDj9Ey7xh52bENqU2oYct6AQxLd8hJv-bY0B_9ZvCajC4cfFCdnQ_2_4QRHWxeEFgf7LkuHkMfg6Ed/pub"
          target="_blank">Open Meetings Policy</a>
        and presented it to the Governance Committee of Asheville City Council. They also prepared a <a
          href="https://openmeetingspolicy.com" target="_blank">petition</a> and gathered support from organizations and
        individuals. Your team may want to use these as models.
      </p>
      <p>As you consider policy recommendations, review the political and legal sections of your STEEPLE Analysis. Look
        at what local policies exist for public meetings and for changing or amending those policies. Keep in mind that local policies can create
        additional requirements for local governments but must still meet all requirements of state law. Some questions to consider:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What actions can you take if a current policy is not being followed in practice?</li>
        <li>What is the process to propose changes to current policy?</li>
        <li>Were there practices used in response to COVID-19 that you would like to make part of your community's policy?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To gain and document support for their policy proposal, Sunshine Request circulated petitions for individuals and organizations.
        You can use the templates provided in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1npiZGlN49CwtoKhp8We5E-HDw9IjStUp?usp=share_link" target="_blank">Forms folder</a>
        of the Toolkit to develop your own petitions.
      </p>
      <h2>Partnerships</h2>
      <p>
        Your team may also want to consider partnerships as a way to make it easier to participate in local government,
        especially by making information easier to access. We provide a few
        examples here. Think carefully before making an ongoing commitment for your team to provide this information. It
        may be better for you to partner with a local non-profit
        that will host the information on an ongoing basis. Your team might be most effective by engaging civic
        technology volunteers to help the non-profit prepare their site, rather
        than trying to start a new organization.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <a href="https://councildataproject.org/" target="_blank">Council Data Project</a> provides a model for
          hosting recordings of local government meetings. The Council Data Project offers open source software so their approach can be used in other communities.</li>

    <section id="faq-section">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <h3>What is a public meeting?</h3>
      <p>We use the term public meeting to refer to local government meetings that are required by law (<a
          href="https://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByArticle/Chapter_143/Article_33C.pdf"
          target="_blank">"NC General Statute Chapter 143 33C"</a>) to allow the public to
        attend and, in some cases, to provide public comment. From the statute: "public body" means any elected or
        appointed authority, board, commission, committee, council,
        or other body of the State, or of one or more counties, cities, school administrative units, constituent
        institutions of The University of North Carolina, or other political
        subdivisions or public corporations in the State that (i) is composed of two or more members and (ii) exercises
        or is authorized to exercise a legislative, policy-making,
        quasi-judicial, administrative, or advisory function." There are a few additional considerations, so if you are
        in doubt, please consult the statute.</p>
      <h3>Can I use the Open Meeting Toolkit for the Carolinas in other places besides North Carolina?</h3>
      <p>There is some interest in adapting the Toolkit for use in other places. Right now, it provides resources for
        North Carolina.</p>
      <h3>Why is a meeting showing up in the wrong place, such as the wrong county or in the ocean?</h3>
      <p>The tools that estimate latitude and longitude depend on a complete, correct address. Some solutions might be to check the address and try again or to look up the location on Google Maps.</p>
      </p>
      <h3>Can a team use the Open Meeting Toolkit without a team leader?</h3>
      <p>Yes, the Toolkit can be used by self-directed teams who share responsibility for leadership.</p>
      </p>
      <h3>What if I notice a technical problem or want to suggest an improvement?</h3>
      <p>The Toolkit is being developed by civic technology volunteers. If you are a civic technology volunteer yourself
        and know how to fix the problem, we invite you to collaborate with us on <a href="https://github.com/sunshine-request" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Another option
        would be to email records@sunshinerequest.org. You are also welcome to modify the openly licensed Toolkit to better meet your needs.</p>
      <h3>What if we didn't attach the Analysis Spreadsheet to our Google Form?</h3>
      <p>If you didn't attach the spreadsheet before collecting responses, you can still use the analysis macros. Copy your responses from the Responses tab of the Form to the Analysis Spreadsheet.
      </p>
      <h3>Is the Toolkit suitable for research?</h3>
      <p>No, the Toolkit provides a structure and resources for local teams to make observations to help inform
        improvements to public meetings in their own communities. Findings from the Toolkit are not intended for publication or as contributions to general
        knowledge. Use of the Toolkit may involve observing some public information about public officials, but in general the Toolkit is for observing
        information about public meetings, not about people.</p>
